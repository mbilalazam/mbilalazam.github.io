I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, and a visiting researcher at Argonne National Laboratory. My work with the DUNE collaboration focuses on developing AI/ML-based methods for neutrino event reconstruction and detector performance studies.

I’m passionate about data, algorithms, and the art of turning complex information into insight. After my Ph.D., I aim to bring this analytical mindset into the AI/ML industry — applying physics-style problem solving to real-world challenges.

Outside research, I write poetry and essays in both Urdu and English, exploring the links between science, language, and human experience. I love teaching, mentoring, and traveling — especially long drives that lead to new ideas and perspectives.

At heart, I’m both a scientist and a storyteller — curious about patterns, meaning, and the beauty hidden in data and life alike.
