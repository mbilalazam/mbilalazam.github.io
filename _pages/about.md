I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, and a visiting graduate researcher in the High Energy Physics Division at Argonne National Laboratory. My research is part of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), where I work on charged track multiplicity analysis and detector performance studies using advanced AI/ML techniques. I also contribute to the calibration and testing of the DUNE photon detection system under the supervision of Dr. Zelimir Djurcic.

My broader interests lie at the intersection of physics, data science, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy building computational models and applying machine learning methods to extract meaningful insights from complex scientific data. After completing my Ph.D., I aim to transition into the AI/ML industry, where I can combine my physics background, analytical thinking, and coding expertise to solve impactful real-world problems.

Outside research, I am an Urdu poet, essayist, and science writer, with published work in both Urdu and English. I love exploring the connection between science, language, and human experience, often writing about the philosophy of science, culture, and curiosity. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring — helping students and beginners develop a deeper and more intuitive understanding of science and computation.

Beyond academia, I am an avid traveler who loves long drives, exploring new places, and immersing myself in different cultures and landscapes. Travel, for me, is another form of discovery — a way to learn, reflect, and stay inspired.

At heart, I see myself as both a scientist and a storyteller — someone who seeks patterns, meaning, and beauty in data, words, and the world around me.
