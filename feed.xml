When we train a deep-learning model to <strong>reconstruct electromagnetic (EM) showers</strong>, we want to know how well it has learned to assemble those pieces back into the right physical picture.</p> <p>To measure that, physicists use a family of <strong>clustering and learning metrics</strong> — mathematical scorecards that tell us how “physicist-like” the machine’s reconstruction really is. Let’s unpack some of these metrics in plain language.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="1-adjusted-rand-index-ari">1. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)</h2> <p>Imagine you and your friend both try to sort puzzle pieces into their correct pictures. The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) checks <strong>how similar your sorting is</strong>, while correcting for the chance that you might agree just by luck.</p> <p>If both of you consistently group the same pairs of pieces together, ARI will be close to <strong>1.0</strong> — perfect agreement. If your grouping is random, it hovers near <strong>0</strong>. Negative values mean you are actively disagreeing (rare, but interesting).</p> <p>Formally, scientists measure it as:</p> \[\text{ARI} = \frac{\text{RI} - E(\text{RI})}{\max(\text{RI}) - E(\text{RI})}\] <p>where the <strong>Rand Index (RI)</strong> measures how consistently pairs are grouped in both the true and predicted clusters:</p> \[\text{RI} = \frac{a + b}{a + b + c + d}\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>\(a\): pairs in the same group in both truth and prediction</li> <li>\(b\): pairs in different groups in both</li> <li>\(c\): pairs in the same group in truth but different in prediction</li> <li>\(d\): pairs in the same group in prediction but different in truth</li> </ul> <h3 id="example-step-by-step-ri-calculation">Example: Step-by-step RI calculation</h3> <p>Let us go through a small example to see where the numbers come from.

Purity — “How clean are the predicted groups?”</h2> <p>Purity examines each <strong>predicted cluster</strong> the model creates. It asks whether all fragments in that cluster truly belong to the same physical shower. A perfectly pure cluster means the model did not mix fragments from different particles. If fragments from two showers end up together, purity drops.</p> \[\text{Purity} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \max_j |c_i \cap t_j|\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(N\): total number of fragments</li> <li>\(c_i\): fragments in predicted cluster \(i\)</li> <li>\(t_j\): fragments in true cluster \(j\)</li> </ul> <p>Think of it like this: each cluster is a jar, and each particle’s fragments are colored marbles. Purity measures how many red marbles slipped into a jar meant for blue ones.</p> <p>High purity = clean clusters, minimal mixing.<br/> But purity alone does not punish <strong>over-splitting</strong> — if one true shower is divided into many small predictions, purity might still look good. That is why we also track <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="3-clustering-efficiency--how-complete-are-the-true-showers">3. Clustering Efficiency — “How complete are the true showers?”</h2> <p>Efficiency flips the question. Instead of asking “Is each prediction clean?”, it asks “Did we recover each true shower completely?”</p> \[\text{Efficiency} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \max_j |t_i \cap c_j|\] <p>A high efficiency means the AI grouped most of a true particle’s fragments together — a test of <strong>completeness</strong>, not cleanliness.</p> <p>A good reconstruction strikes a balance:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Purity</strong> rewards precision (no contamination).</li> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> rewards recall (no fragmentation).</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br/> Purity is like making sure no wrong puzzle pieces are in your pile.<br/> Efficiency is making sure you actually found <em>all</em> the right ones.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="4-edge-and-node-accuracy">4. Edge and Node Accuracy</h2> <p>Inside the model, each event becomes a <strong>graph</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Nodes are fragments.</li> <li>Edges represent possible connections — “same shower or not?”</li> </ul> <p>The AI predicts 1 if two fragments belong to the same shower, and 0 otherwise. The <strong>edge accuracy</strong> is simply:</p> \[\text{Edge Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct edge predictions}}{\text{Total edges}}\] <p>Similarly, <strong>node accuracy</strong> checks whether each fragment is correctly labeled as a <em>primary</em> — the one that started the shower.</p> <blockquote> <p>In other words, edge accuracy tests relationships, while node accuracy tests identities. Together, they reveal how well the AI has learned the physics of connectivity.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="5-loss--how-far-are-predictions-from-the-truth">5. Loss — “How far are predictions from the truth?”</h2> <p>While accuracy counts how many predictions were right, <strong>loss</strong> tells us <em>how confident</em> the model was when it was right or wrong. It is computed with <strong>Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)</strong> — a function that punishes confident mistakes more heavily than hesitant ones.</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_e + \mathcal{L}_v\] <p>where</p> \[\mathcal{L}_e = -\frac{1}{N_e} \sum_{(i,j)} \Big[a_{ij} \ln(s_{ij}^e) + (1 - a_{ij}) \ln(1 - s_{ij}^e)\Big]\] <p>and</p> \[\mathcal{L}_v = -\frac{1}{N_v} \sum_i \Big[y_i \ln(s_i^v) + (1 - y_i) \ln(1 - s_i^v)\Big]\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>\(s_{ij}^e\): predicted probability that two fragments belong together</li> <li>\(s_i^v\): predicted probability that a fragment is primary</li> <li>\(a_{ij}, y_i \in \{0,1\}\): true labels</li> </ul> <p>Lower loss = closer alignment between machine predictions and physical truth.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="6-putting-it-all-together">6.

From now on, we will begin paving the path for the discrete versions of spacetime. A famous adage says, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” and this is profoundly true in science. The relation between physics and figures is as old as the history of physics itself. A typical science student becomes familiar with figures (particularly <em>free-body diagrams</em>) while solving everyday mechanics problems via Newton’s laws. In the second half of the last century, Feynman elevated diagrams to a new level, using them to study complex quantum interactions and associating equations with different segments of those diagrams. In the next section, we briefly review some notable examples — from quantum field theory to relativity.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="an-equation-and-a-picture">An Equation and a Picture</h2> <p>The idea of modeling physical processes — or even equations — through <em>pictures</em> dates back to the iconoclastic Richard P. Feynman, who introduced his famous diagrams in 1949 <d-cite key="Feynman1949"></d-cite>. Feynman diagrams provide simple visualizations of abstract mathematical ideas. Imagine electrons represented by solid lines. Arrows pointing forward in time denote particles; those pointing backward represent antiparticles. When two such lines meet and exchange a photon (a wiggly line), the diagram captures the entire interaction. The first published Feynman diagram is shown below. Employing Feynman rules, one can assign mathematical formulas to each part of the diagram — and the computed results match those from the cumbersome mathematics of quantum fields.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Exchange of one photon between two electrons (Feynman 1949)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Exchange of one photon between two electrons (<d-cite key="Feynman1949"></d-cite>). </div> </div> </div> <p>Feynman diagrams have proved so useful that they have become integral to quantum field theory.

Lower-level structures — drawn as filled dots inside these open nodes — connect via lines to other nodes or remain isolated. This recalls the “ball-and-stick” molecular model. In physics, however, these structures are far simpler yet extremely powerful: they encode <em>classical universes</em> or <em>histories</em>. Both terms are used interchangeably in causal theories, though “histories” emphasizes an extended process rather than isolated snapshots of spacetime. At this stage, we are not yet concerned with what these histories model or their size. But since they form the most fundamental structural units of spacetime, they must represent local processes such as particle interactions — likely many orders of magnitude smaller than the particles themselves.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="representation-of-structures">Representation of Structures</h2> <p>The “ball-and-stick” (or “node-and-edge”) representation exists at both structural levels. However, the edges are <em>directed</em> — each connecting an initial and a terminal node. These nodes are <em>events</em>, and the directed edges represent <em>cause-and-effect</em> relations. This is where <strong>causality</strong> enters. Such sets of events (or objects) are called <em>directed sets</em><d-footnote>I will explain its technical details in upcoming posts.</d-footnote>. Before proceeding, we label the two structural levels as:</p> <ul> <li>Higher-level structures → <em>quantum structures</em></li> <li>Lower-level structures → <em>classical structures</em></li> </ul> <p>Many readers may find this labeling counterintuitive: classical physics usually describes <em>large-scale</em> behavior, while quantum theory deals with the <em>microscopic</em>. Yet, this labeling becomes natural when viewed through Feynman’s <em>path-integral</em> (or <em>sum-over-histories</em>) approach <d-cite key="Feynman2005"></d-cite>. Feynman’s 1948 formulation generalizes the classical action principle. In classical mechanics, a particle has a unique trajectory between two points. In Feynman’s framework, it may take <em>any</em> of infinitely many paths. Each possible path contributes a phase (or amplitude), and summing all phases yields the observable quantum amplitude. In Feynman’s own words <d-cite key="Herbert1987"></d-cite>:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The electron does anything it likes … It goes in any direction at any speed, forward and backward in time, however it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the wave function.”</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>Another reason to accept this “inverted” labeling is the <strong>supremacy of quantum theory</strong>: the classical world emerges from quantum principles. In our terminology, higher-level (quantum) structures generate lower-level (classical) ones. To clarify what “classical” means, let’s note:</p> <ul> <li>Technically, it refers to a <em>specific permissible physical scenario</em> — for example, a unique trajectory. In discrete causal theories, such scenarios are determined from the axioms rather than from equations of motion. Histories satisfying these axioms are <em>permissible</em> and treated equally; those that don’t are excluded.</li> <li>Conventionally, “classical” describes anything measurable at large scales and low energies. Bohr’s correspondence principle formalizes this: <blockquote> <p>“The predictions of classical and quantum mechanics agree in the limit of large quantum numbers.” <d-cite key="French1979"></d-cite></p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Hence, quantum and classical theories are equally fundamental but describe different structural levels. The quantum structure is <strong>more complete</strong>, encompassing all possible scenarios, while the classical structure isolates a single one.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="how-to-model-a-picture-with-an-equation">How to Model a Picture with an Equation?</h2> <p>The hierarchical structure we’ve discussed naturally defines a <strong>structured configuration space</strong> — a <em>kinematic scheme</em> encoded by sequential evolutionary processes. A configuration space represents all possible states of a system.</p> <p>For example, in classical mechanics, a particle’s position is given by coordinates $(x, y, z)$. To describe motion, we use two sets of coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, forming a function $\psi(x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2)$ which lives in a six-dimensional configuration space.</p> <p>By generalizing this concept through a <em>path-summation</em> approach, any quantum object can be represented in such a space. To “model a picture with an equation,” we sum contributions from all possible paths in this configuration space — after translating structural points into appropriate mathematical objects. This process yields quantum amplitudes and observables, forming a predictive framework that emerges naturally from the underlying causal structure of events.

(PDF)</a></p> <p>In the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</em>, in 1929, one of the giants of the twentieth-century scientific community, Paul Dirac narrated <d-cite key="Dirac1929"></d-cite> at a moment:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known.”</p> </blockquote> <p>However, the advancements in technology and innovative mathematical theories to study nature at its fundamentals made this statement quite vague, in essence, with the passage of time. People also stated the same when the discovery of the Higgs boson completed the mysterious puzzle of the Standard Model (SM) and made heuristic additions to our understanding of the universe, but then cosmology played its role to change the game and showed that the successful SM explains only around four percent of the universe while the nature and dynamics of the rest of the twenty-six percent dark matter and the seventy percent dark energy cannot be explained under its realm.</p> <p>These and some other compelling arguments again convinced the scientists to think of a more fundamental formalism to describe the underlying phenomena of nature — that is, a <em>theory of quantum gravity</em> — the merger of classical general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/ch01_fig01_contents-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/ch01_fig01_contents-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/ch01_fig01_contents-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/ch01_fig01_contents.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Pie Chart of the content of the Universe (Credits: NASA/WMAP Science Team)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Pie chart of the content of the Universe (Credits: NASA/WMAP Science Team). </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="the-basic-idea">The Basic Idea</h2> <p>Since the formulation of Einstein’s general relativity and quantum mechanics, both theories were (and are) successfully tested millions of times, which depicts how much important these theories are to modern-day science. In their formalism and ideas, both are far apart. General relativity is classical in nature, while quantum mechanics upholds the idea of quantization and interference at the subatomic scale. Quantum (field) theory successfully accommodates all the interactions of nature in its framework but gravity. This framework is called the <strong>Standard Model of Particle Physics</strong>. However, general relativity is the only available tool to study all the manifestations of the gravitational field. Despite all the efforts, we are unable to wed general relativity to quantum theory. Anyhow, some questions instantly pop out regarding their merger:</p> <ol> <li>Why do we want to unify these two theories?</li> <li>Is it not possible that gravity is a classical theory and has no quantum roots?</li> <li>Is it really challenging to quantize gravity?</li> </ol> <p>Skip the first two questions for a moment and come to the very last question. The answer is <strong>no</strong> — it is not difficult to quantize gravity. We know how to canonically quantize<d-footnote>Canonical quantization, introduced by Dirac <d-cite key="Dirac1925"></d-cite>, is one of the most direct and simplest ways to quantize classical theories.</d-footnote> fields. People have already done it for non-gravitational fields such as electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear. It is exquisite and simple machinery.</p> <ol> <li><em>Write down</em> the classical Lagrangian density in terms of fields.</li> <li><em>Calculate</em> momentum and Hamiltonian densities as fields.</li> <li><em>Treat</em> these field densities as operators.</li> <li><em>Impose</em> commutation relations to make them quantum mechanical.</li> <li><em>Expand</em> the fields in terms of ladder operators.</li> </ol> <p>And that’s it — the classical field has been quantized successfully.</p> <p>The same trick can also be applied to the gravitational field. So, then? Would not this be the desired theory of quantum gravity? If it is straightforward, why are physicists struggling? To answer this, let us visit the first two questions in the next section.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="motivations-for-quantum-gravity">Motivations for Quantum Gravity</h3> <p>Before proceeding, it would be essential to note that certain <em>uniqueness theorems</em> say whatever theory of quantum gravity we develop must approximate Einstein’s GR (or Einstein–Cartan theory<d-footnote>Einstein–Cartan theory is the natural generalization of GR. It is written in the language of tensors and spinors to accommodate fermions and quarks in gravity. (We might discuss it in detail at some later point.)</d-footnote>) in some limit.</p> <p>General relativity is a remarkably successful theory in its realm. Still, there are some rudimentary observational pieces of evidence that point out discrepancies in theoretical models and suggest a more fundamental viewpoint about gravity. Some of the primary motivations for quantum gravity are:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Unification:</strong><br/> Physicists are reductionists. The history of science shows that reductionism has been proven very successful. The Standard Model is one of its prime examples where all the non-gravitational interactions can be studied under a single gauge group, $\mathrm{SU(3)} \times \mathrm{SU(2)} \times \mathrm{U(1)}.$ In the last century, we have seen the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces (electroweak). Why would there be a reason gravity cannot be unified with others? It should be.</p> <p>Interestingly, there are also attempts to construct semiclassical frameworks in which all other forces are quantum while gravity remains essentially classical. However, all of these efforts have failed miserably. It indicates that classical and quantum concepts are likely incompatible, as inferred in the early days of quantum mechanics.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Universe:</strong><br/> All the attempts of gravity quantization face one severe problem — they are not UV complete. They break at high-energy scales. From the evolution history of the universe<d-footnote><a href="https://mbilalazam.com/1-evolution-history-of-universe-a-story-from-zero-to-ten-seconds/" target="_blank">Evolution History of the Universe — A Story from Zero to Ten Seconds</a></d-footnote>, it is known that the present classical infrastructure of gravity tells us nothing about the initial conditions near the Big Bang or what happens at the sub-Planckian scale and final stages of black hole evolution. I want to discuss one example from cosmology and one from black holes in some detail.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Cosmology:</strong><br/> There are cosmological solutions, in agreement with observations, that successfully predict an accelerated expansion of the universe<d-footnote>We will discuss this problem in detail in the phenomenology of causal set theory.</d-footnote>. From this result, it can be extrapolated that this expansion started, at some zero cosmic time, from a highly dense point (or singularity) with no spatial dimensions. It is where classical GR fails to yield any feasible result(s). This inability to extract any information from this singularity and the subsequent Planck era signifies the need for a theory of quantized gravity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Holes:</strong><br/> Annoyingly mysterious black holes also qualify as a testable region for quantum gravity. In the early seventies, Bekenstein interpreted the entropy of a black hole in terms of the area of its event horizon <d-cite key="Bekenstein1973"></d-cite>, and Hawking conjectured that black holes emit thermal radiation having a black-body spectrum <d-cite key="Hawking1975"></d-cite>. This brings about an identicalness in the thermal behavior of black holes and the conventional laws of thermodynamics. Classical GR fails to explain it well because entropy is described under the notion of discrete states of a quantum system in traditional thermodynamics. It makes black hole entropy phenomenologically important in the search for quantized gravity.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Time:</strong><br/> It is one of the most radical issues in the pursuit of QG. Quantum and generally covariant theories (like GR) have drastically different concepts of time — they are incompatible. In quantum theory, time is available as an external parameter. It is not described by an operator; it is kinematical, absolute, and universal. Even in relativistic QFT, external Minkowski spacetime plays the role of absolute time. While in GR, time is a dynamical object. It is relative and non-absolute. It is not available as an external parameter; it needs to be constructed <em>naturally</em> by the theory itself. It is quite clear that the definition of time must be modified to develop a fully fledged theory of quantum gravity. We will revisit the problem of time while discussing the role of background structures in quantum gravity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Divergence:</strong><br/> Gravity is non-renormalizable. It breaks at high-energy scales and yields infinities. It is still an open issue how to cure these divergences. There should be no divergences for any quantum version of gravity, as there are none in quantum field theory.</p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="cut-off-scales-of-quantum-gravity">Cut-Off Scales of Quantum Gravity</h2> <p>Length, mass, and time are fundamental — the most basic physical quantities — and the speed of light $(c)$, gravitational constant $(G)$, and quantum of action $(\hbar)$ are the fundamental constants of nature. Can we form these quantities from the constants of general relativity, $c$ and $G$, or the constants of quantum theory, $c$ and $\hbar$? <strong>No!</strong> There is no possible combination of these two sets of universal constants that can produce any of the fundamental quantities.</p> <p>But can we derive these quantities using <em>all</em> of these constants in any combination? <strong>Yes.</strong> In honor of Max Planck, these units are called <em>Planck units</em><d-footnote>For the sake of completeness — Planck units are defined exclusively in terms of four universal constants. The fourth one is the Boltzmann constant, $k_\text{B}$. Using the four constants, one can also define Planck units of temperature, density, the fine-structure constant of gravity, and charge.</d-footnote>. These units are:</p> \[\begin{align*} \text{Planck length} &amp;= l_\text{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.62\times10^{-33}\ \text{cm}, \\ \text{Planck time} &amp;= t_\text{P} = \frac{l_\text{P}}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.39\times10^{-44}\ \text{s}, \\ \text{Planck mass} &amp;= m_\text{P} = \frac{\hbar}{l_\text{P} c} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.18\times10^{-5}\ \text{g}. \end{align*}\] <p>One may be bewildered by noticing that Planck mass is horrendously a larger quantity than Planck length and Planck time. But it is worth noting that $m_\text{P}$ must be concentrated in a linear dimension $l_\text{P}$; otherwise, we will not be able to observe quantum effects of gravity. At this scale, classical properties become an emergent phenomenon of quantum theory. These scales provide the cut-offs to observe quantum gravity.</p> <p>We can easily realize that these scales are nearly impossible to detect and observe with the present technology. However, these scales do not provide stringent limits on gravity — these are just the most natural possible cut-offs. The unified theory of forces may also contain other parameters; for instance, in string theory, the fundamental length scale is the string length $l_\text{S}$ rather than the Planck length $l_\text{P}$. Nevertheless, it is an educated guess to set $l_\text{S} = l_\text{P}$.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="approaches-to-quantum-gravity">Approaches to Quantum Gravity</h2> <p>Since the 1930s, there has been no shortage of proposed theories for the quantization of gravitational fields<d-footnote>A list of candidate theories can be found on the following Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#Candidate_theories" target="_blank">Quantum Gravity — Candidate Theories</a>. However, this is not an exhaustive list.</d-footnote>. No idea is complete; no theory is entirely consistent with quantum fields. No theory provides a way to put it to experimental tests; every approach suffers from conceptual problems. Every theory meets observational discrepancies.</p> <p>Issues are there, but even today, the charm of quantum gravity has not faded away — nothing is more fascinating than the problems of gravity. It is challenging to review all the approaches to quantum gravity in just one section; however, I will try to briefly discuss its main research directions. The subsequent sections may contain some <em>fancy</em> technical terms which I will intentionally try to oversimplify, and it may cause the text to lose some of its essence (so advanced readers are advised to see <d-cite key="Oriti2009"></d-cite> and <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite> and references therein, upon which this section is based).</p> <h3 id="three-and-half-directions">Three-and-Half Directions</h3> <p>Research in quantum gravity can be mapped onto three main — and some <em>neglected</em> — lines:</p> <ul> <li>covariant</li> <li>canonical</li> <li>sum-over-histories</li> <li>others</li> </ul> <p>This list does not qualify to be a precise way to describe research directions since these names are somewhat misleading and sometimes are used interchangeably. Still, they possess specific scientific rationality, developmental logic, and methodological unity. Often, one approach becomes a hot topic, and others get neglected — this has happened repeatedly over the years. However, all of these approaches share some common features, and many ideas cannot fit neatly into any one of these directions.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covariant Approach:</strong><br/> Started in the early thirties by Rosenfeld, Fierz, and Pauli, it is one of the most dominant research directions in the pursuit of quantum gravity. It is an attempt to construct a quantum field theory of gravity. In covariant approaches, fluctuations of the metric element are studied over a four-dimensional Lorentzian flat spacetime or some other appropriate background metric. Rules and equations were established in the sixties by Feynman, Faddeev, and others, while the approach was proved to be non-renormalizable by ’t Hooft and others in the seventies. The search for renormalizability gave birth to string theory in the late eighties — whose sun has not set to date.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Canonical Approach:</strong><br/> Initiated by Dirac and pioneered by Wheeler, DeWitt, and Ashtekar, it is the Hamiltonian (or canonical) formulation of general relativity. In this approach, phase-space variables are promoted to quantum operators on a Hilbert space, and these operators correspond to the full metric or some of its functions. The canonical approach started gaining attention when the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG) was established. LQG remains one of the most significant competitors to string theory.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sum-Over-Histories Approach:</strong><br/> Feynman pioneered the path-integral (SOH) formulation, which proved itself as one of the most successful formalisms of quantum theory. In the quantum world, there are infinite ways (paths) to go from some initial point to a final point, and the probabilities are given by adding contributions from all the possible trajectories (or histories). Similarly, in gravity, this sum is taken over all possible geometries of spacetime. Some discrete causal approaches to quantum gravity are based on different versions of SOH — for instance, the spinfoam formalism or the causal set approach.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Other Approaches:</strong><br/> These include effective field theories (such as non-commutative geometry), Penrose’s twistor theory, Regge calculus, causal dynamical triangulation, causal sets, and many more. Some of the alternate approaches have suffered from serious and fundamental crises, while others are too mathematical to describe physical reality. Still, many of these ideas provide astonishing insight into the phenomenology of quantum gravity and bridge the gap between theoretical and observational discrepancies.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is also important to note that only string theory claims to be the unified version of all fundamental forces — or, loosely speaking, the <em>theory of everything</em> — while all other approaches provide different ways to merge quantum theory with general relativity. None of these approaches have matured into fully fledged quantum versions of gravity. All ideas are still in development. Some proposed versions of gravitational theories have an established kinematical side but lack a dynamical framework. For avid history readers, the evolution of research in quantum gravity is summed up in Figure below, taken from <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Lastly, we have briefly reviewed the idea of quantum gravity, its need, present problems, and some of the possible directions. Readers may visit the references (and references therein) for a detailed outlook of the topic. This series is dedicated to <em>causal set theory</em>, initiated by Rafael Sorkin in the early eighties, and from the next post, we will try to discuss it from the very basics. We will discuss the need for discrete causal approaches and the causal metric hypothesis, which will lead us to one of the most important theoretical breakthroughs of the last century — <em>metric recovery theorems</em>.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/history_of_qg_rovelli.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/history_of_qg_rovelli.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The search for a quantum theory of the gravitational field (adapted from Rovelli 2004)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The search for a quantum theory of the gravitational field (adapted from <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite>). </div> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="quantum-gravity"/><category term="causal-set-theory"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation behind quantum gravity and causal sets.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan</title><link href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan"/><published>2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin/"><![CDATA[<p>📄 A printable version of this article is available <a href="https://github.com/mbilalazam/mbilalazam.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/dr_riazuddin.pdf">Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan (PDF)</a></p> <blockquote> <p><em>A tribute to one of Pakistan’s greatest theoretical physicists,<br/> whose quiet brilliance helped shape the nation’s scientific destiny.</em></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>It was tumultuous 1947 when the world observed the violent partition of India. Bloodthirsty savages put up communal riots all over the country. Religiously divided Ludhiana was also engulfed. Meanwhile, a lower middle-class family left the city for good and migrated to the newly established Pakistan. There were 17 years old twins in the family, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin, who schooled in Islamia High School ran by Anjuman-i-Islamia philanthropy. Their inquisitiveness and appetite for knowledge were out of bounds. It was an ultimate sign of their dedication towards the beloved homeland that after losing all material possession in migration, they didn’t bemoan but ready to construe dreams with the hope of bright future. So the family enrolled the children in Government Muhammadan Oriental (MAO) College but soon got admission in Government College Lahore (now Government College University, Lahore) in 1949.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Professor Riazuddin — Early Years" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Professor Riazuddin (1930–2013), one of Pakistan’s most distinguished theoretical physicists.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/phys/khodja/Riazuddin.htm" target="_blank">King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>In Government College Lahore, they started studying engineering but they couldn’t make their way spectacular and stunning. So a teacher there suggested them to study physics rather than engineering. Riazuddin gave his assent. Although it was quite disturbing and uninteresting situation for Riazuddin yet it was the outset of a celebrated career in the cosmos of physics. It was Government College Lahore, where Riazuddin met with his mentor Abdus Salam, in 1951. Salam’s sharp-witted personality and perspicacity to deal with theories in physics made him the rising star in the physics community all over the world. It was not only Riazuddin but the nations who spurred by Salam. After declining the offer of professorship at Cambridge, Salam joined Government College, Lahore and at the same time, he started a new course of Quantum Mechanics in Punjab University, Lahore. It was Salam’s repute who drew the attention of students. But only Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin got success in surviving the thicket of mathematical equations involved in quantum mechanics. Although it was a disheartened experience for Salam yet the twins made their identification as best students in that course.</p> <hr/> <p>Riazuddin got his Master’s degree in mathematics from Government College Lahore under the mentorship of Abdus Salam and joined his alma mater in 1954 as a lecturer in mathematics. Riazuddin left for Cambridge in 1955 on the invitation of Dr. Abdus Salam to pursue his doctorate under his supervision. His dissertation entitled <em>“Charge Radius of Pion”</em> got published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on May 15, 1959. It dealt with certain regularities underlying nuclear forces. It was an influential research paper but something more outstanding was yet to come.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Riazuddin with Abdus Salam at ICTP, Trieste" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Professor Riazuddin (left) with his mentor, Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam, at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://www.ictp.it/news/2013/9/memoriam" target="_blank">ICTP — In Memoriam (2013)</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>After his return to Pakistan in 1959, he joined Punjab University Lahore as an associate professor of mathematics. In 1963, Norman March and Michael Duff awarded him a fellowship in the United States and he became a research associate professor at University of Rochester. He stayed there until 1965. His stay extended there and in 1965, he joined the University of Pennsylvania to teach physics until 1966. Meantime, his brother Fayyazuddin also completed his doctorate on <em>“Preliminary Analysis of Photoproduction of K Mesons in the Mandelstam Representation.”</em> On his way to University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi Institute, Riazuddin convened his brother along with Faheem Hussain (late) <d-footnote>Faheem Hussain was recently awarded *Spirit of Abdus Salam Award (2016)* along with Seifallah Randjbar-Daemi and Galileo Violini by *The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)* Trieste, Italy.</d-footnote> in Illinois. In 1966, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin published an authoritative research paper entitled <em>“Algebra of Current Components and Decay Widths of ρ and K* Mesons”</em> in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on July 29, 1966. It is the widely used Kawarabayashi–Suzuki–Riazuddin–Fayyazuddin (KSRF) relation. Actually, this fruitful relation was separately derived by Japanese scientists Ken Kawarabayashi and Mahiko Suzuki and Pakistani twin scientists Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin. According to Pervez Hoodbhoy, <em>“The Relation (KSRF) has stood the test of experiment, but even today continues to tantalize physicists — because it works so much better than it really should.”</em></p> <hr/> <p>Riazuddin found 1968, an efficacious year, for him. He came back to Pakistan on the request of Abdus Salam and joined Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad’s Institute of Physics (now National Centre for Physics). Vibrant research groups on relativity, particle physics, and string theory were brought about in those days. On Salam’s postulation, Enrico Fermi Institute had also engaged its scientists in such groups. It was the start of an entirely new epoch in the field of physics in Pakistan. But still there is one more thing was to come into being on the part of Riazuddin in 1969, which made him acknowledged all over the world. It was his classical and well-founded textbook in particle physics <em>Theory of Weak Interactions in Particle Physics</em> coauthored with C. P. Ryan and Robert E. Marshak. He also penned two widely recognized textbooks, together with Fayyazuddin, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> in 1990 and <em>A Modern Introduction to Particle Physics</em> in 1992.</p> <hr/> <p>Salam’s relation with Riazuddin was lenient and unparalleled. Two nonpareil physicists of the homeland enthralled the physicists of all castes and creeds all over the world. International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Trieste, Italy shortly after its establishment became world’s leading cornerstone research institute. Riazuddin, along with Salam’s other students, created theoretical physics group there.</p> <p>Astonishingly, it was ICTP, where Salam summoned Riazuddin and advised him to meet Munir Ahmed Khan upon his return to Pakistan to start the progress for the designing of the atomic bomb. In Salam’s views, the creation of theoretical physics group in Pakistan was mandatary to explore the technical aspects of fissile core and triggering mechanics of fissile material. Riazuddin made himself busy in the collection and analysis of data, which he procured from research papers, Manhattan project, Los Alamos laboratory etc. and started working day and night with sagacious engineers and canny physicists. Now, the rest was history. By shrugging off conspiracies, Pakistan made its way towards success. There was mass jubilation on May 28, 1998.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and Pervez Hoodbhoy at Quaid-i-Azam University, 2012" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and Pervez Hoodbhoy relaxing at the tea huts, Quaid-i-Azam University, 2012.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/778147-a-physicists-journey" target="_blank">The News International — “A Physicist’s Journey”</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>Overlooking minute details, in my opinion, the nation has forgotten the man who adept at complex calculations involved in the set-up of a nuclear arsenal. Riazuddin played a seminal and catalytic role, on the advice of Abdus Salam, in Pakistan’s nuclear program. He awarded with <em>Hilal-i-Imtiaz</em> by the Government of Pakistan but it can never be the meed of Riazuddin’s diligence.</p> <p>Once Riazuddin dreamt that he would transform and develop National Centre for Physics on the lines of ICTP. He became the director of NCP but unluckily owing to administrative and political reasons, he could not have expounded his dream and removed by authorities from the directorship of NCP.</p> <p>Riazuddin remained in search of something new. He wanted to find modern ways to look at. Being a dignified professor, it was his commitment and passion which made him the great Riazuddin. He knew how to evolve in the essence of theoretical physics. Around 165 research papers in reputed journals all over the world, more than 1900 citations along with a number of books, Riazuddin became one of the ever-leading physicists of the country.</p> <hr/> <p>One can easily recognize his thirst for knowledge by the fact that this self-effacing quintessential physicist published his last paper on August 20, 2013 at the age of 82 just 29 days before his demise. On September 9, 2013, this archetypal scientist took his last breath but had left an unexampled legacy. Motherland produced only a handful of physicists like Riazuddin who have exceptional advocacy and subservient innovation. He left this materialistic world but his affection and services will remain forever with us.<br/> Riazuddin made us proud. We cannot pay his debt for the services he offered for us. But we can tribute to his intentness by following his footsteps with great zeal, glorious knack, coherent allegiance, and continuous hard work.</p> <p>He often said that <em>“It was the idealism of the youth which not only enabled many of us, who could have stayed abroad, to return, but also infused a great enthusiasm to succeed in the pioneering role of establishing a new institution from scratch.”</em><br/> He tried to encourage his students, talented youth of motherland, with sententious comments:<br/> <em>“One has to live this life only once in this world. So try to do something of which you would proud of. Learn and spread knowledge and try to create new knowledge. Be helpful to others.”</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="Pakistan"/><category term="history"/><category term="Abdus"/><category term="Salam"/><category term="Riazuddin"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tribute article on Professor Riazuddin — one of Pakistan’s greatest theoretical physicists and a close collaborator of Abdus Salam.]]></summary></entry></feed>
